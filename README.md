# NYCrimeSpot 


Data plays an important aspect for any business, project or just to have information available for anyone who may benefit from it. 
Living in a populated city we have deemed a crime database/system to be good to have information for New Yorkers, tourists, researchers, 
anyone who is looking to move within New York boroughs, visitors looking to explore NY and/or Property Investors. 

The team is looking to create a system that will provide users with information that they may be looking for before visiting different 
boroughs and/or investing on properties. As a team, we are looking to serve as the bridge between data on crime rates and NYC Boroughs.
